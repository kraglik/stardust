# Stardust actor framework

This is a new version of the stardust framework that uses asyncio for concurrency.

This framework is very WIP and unoptimized at the moment.

# Further development

I want to experiment with python-nogil, as it allows me to do exactly what I wanted to do initially, when I had to use processes and serialize coroutines and everything they depend on.
