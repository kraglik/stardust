# Stardust actor framework

This is a new version of the stardust framework that uses asyncio for concurrency.

This framework is very WIP and unoptimized at the moment.
I'm working on fixing some of its bugs and trying it out at web-related tasks.

My best version of this framework did several tens of thousands of messages per second.
This version does 3k messages per second, which is quite bad. But, still, it has room for improvement.
